      <description>When I was a little girl, I loved horses with all my heart. Being raised outside of Chicago, there were no real horses within a 50 mile radius. To this day, I still have a love for horses and they are my all time favorite subject to paint. The subject is Beau my very first horse. I painted in the moment before he recognises me, someday, in heaven.

      <description>In &amp;ldquo;Lonely Cow Dark&amp;rdquo;, the trailer in the background will likely be used to take him to processing. Lonely cow is actually a calf that was weaned from his mother near Boyd, Texas. He would see me drive up in my little black car and was convinced it was his mom. He would run to the fence and call out to my car. This little calf was alone in a massive pasture and wanted to make a connection with someone.</description>

      <description>In &amp;ldquo;Lonely Cow Day&amp;rdquo;, the barn in the distance offers shelter without companionship.
