      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

      <description>When I was a little girl, I loved horses with all my heart. Being raised outside of Chicago, there were no real horses within a 50 mile radius. To this day, I still have a love for horses and they are my all time favorite subject to paint. The subject is Beau my very first horse. I painted in the moment before he recognises me, someday, in heaven.

      <description>In &amp;ldquo;Lonely Cow Dark&amp;rdquo;, the trailer in the background will likely be used to take him to processing. Lonely cow is actually a calf that was weaned from his mother near Boyd, Texas. He would see me drive up in my little black car and was convinced it was his mom. He would run to the fence and call out to my car. This little calf was alone in a massive pasture and wanted to make a connection with someone.</description>

      <description>In &amp;ldquo;Lonely Cow Day&amp;rdquo;, the barn in the distance offers shelter without companionship.

      <description>This is one of the beautiful horses on the carousel at the Dallas Zoo. I also love painting carousel horses. They were the first horses I fell in love with as a little girl.

      <description>Dukie is a 4 year old Morkie, half Maltese, and half Yorkie. He is owned and loved by my daughter Cally. She brings him over to visit, and he is fascinated by the fish in the pond. He likes to pose for pictures and is very easy for me to paint. 16&amp;rsquo;x20&amp;rsquo; canvas in oil.</description>

      <description>In this painting I did not use a brush but tried my hand at painting with a palette knife. Buddy is a breeding stock paint horse. Typically paint horses have white markings on their body but Buddy was an exception without any. Oil on canvas 2015</description>
